# Data acquisition and thinking in React

### To run the Workshop code:

```sh
yarn && yarn start
```

## Tasks

- Style components - className, inline styles, style objects
- Can you see patterns in the components? Can you optimise them?
- Add a button to filter for each of the squads

**Bonus points**

- Add a 'HIRED! Form to add a new staff member
- Add a 'FIRED!' Button to remove a staff member

It's ok to use filteredData for these, but adding the initial data to state and updating that gets bonus points!
